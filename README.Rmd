The goal of INQC is to perform quality control (QC) of climatological daily time series. INQC consists of a number of functions which provide a wide range of QC tests for almost all types of errors in daily data and almost all climate variables such as air temperature, atmospheric precipitation, pressure etc. Originally, INQC was created in order to QC the [ECA&D](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/predefinedseries.php) station data in the frame of the [INDECIS](http://www.indecis.eu/) project. However, INQC's functions can be used to deal with quality control problems in any other climatological data set with the daily time resolution.
