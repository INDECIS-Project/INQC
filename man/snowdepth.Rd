\title{QC for Snow Depth (SD)}
\usage{
snowdepth(
  element = "SD",
  maxseq = 20,
  blocksizeround = 20,
  blockmanymonth = 20,
  blockmanyyear = 200,
  large = 5000,
  exclude = 0,
  inisia = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{element}{two-letters ECA&D code for the element (SD for snow depth)}

\item{maxseq}{maximum number of consecutive repeated values, FUNCTION: flat() (11.1,11.1,11.1 would be 3 consecutive values)}

\item{blocksizeround}{maximum number of values in a month with the same decimal, FUNCTION: rounding()}

\item{blockmanymonth}{maximum number of equal values in a month, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blockmanyyear}{maximum number of equal values in a year, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{large}{value above which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region, FUNCTION: physics()}

\item{exclude}{value to be excluded from a function (in this case, 0 for flats)}

\item{inisia}{logical flag. If it is TRUE inithome() will be called}
}
\value{
results of QC for SD
}
\description{
This function will centralize temperature-like QC routines. It will create a file in the folder QC
with an additional 0/1 column, where "1" means test failed.
}
\examples{
#Set a temporal working directory:
wd <- tempdir()
wd0 <- setwd(wd)
#Create subdirectory where raw data files have to be located
dir.create(file.path(wd, 'raw'))
options("homefolder"='./'); options("blend"=FALSE)
#Extract the ECA&D data and station files from the example data folder
path2sdlist<-system.file("extdata", "ECA_blend_source_sd.txt", package = "INQC")
sdlist<-readr::read_lines_raw(path2sdlist)
readr::write_lines(sdlist,'ECA_blend_source_sd.txt')
path2sddata<-system.file("extdata", "SD_SOUID132731.txt", package = "INQC")
sddata<-readr::read_lines_raw(path2sddata)
readr::write_lines(sddata, file=paste(wd,'\\\\raw\\\\SD_SOUID132731.txt',sep=''))
#Perform QC of Snow Depth data
snowdepth(inisia=TRUE)
#Remove some temporary files
list = list.files(pattern = "Rfwf")
file.remove(list)
#Return to user's working directory:
setwd(wd0)
#The downloaded files can be found in directory:
print(wd)
