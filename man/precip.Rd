\arguments{
\item{element}{two-letters ECA&D code for the element (RR for precipitation)}

\item{large}{value above which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region}

\item{small}{value below which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region}

\item{ret}{pseudo-return period for the pareto outliers}

\item{retornoracha}{return period for the calculation of the maximum dry and wet spell}

\item{margin}{frequency difference between consecutive values for repeatedvalue()}

\item{friki}{minimum value to be considered by repeatedvalue()}

\item{blocksizeround}{maximum number of repeated values with the same decimal, FUNCTION: roundprecip()}

\item{blockmanymonth}{maximum number of equal values in a month, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blockmanyyear}{maximum number of equal values in a year, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{limit}{cut threshold for FUNCTION suspectacumprec()}

\item{tolerance}{number of NA or 0s before allowed before the limit, FUNCTION: suspectacumprec()}

\item{maxseq}{maximum number of consecutive repeated values, FUNCTION: flat() (11.1,11.1,11.1 would be 3 consecutive values)}

\item{roundmax}{maximum number of consecutive decimal part values, FUNCTION: flat() (10.0, 11.0, 12.0 would be 3 consecutive values)}

\item{level}{number of IQRs, FUNCTION: IQRoutliers()}

\item{window}{number of days to be considered (including the target), FUNCTION: IQRoutliers()}

\item{margina}{a tolerance margin, expressed as quantile of the differences, FUNCTION: newfriki()}

\item{inisia}{a logical flag. If it is TRUE inithome() will be called}

results of QC for RR

\description{
This function will centralize precipitation-like QC routines. It will create a file in the folder QC
with an additional 0/1 column, where "1" means test failed.
