\arguments{
\item{element}{two-letters ECA&D code for the element ('TX' for daily maximum temperature,
'TN' for daily minimum temperature, 'TG' for daily mean temperature) passed as character string}

\item{large}{value above which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region. Defaulted to 500. Passed on to physics(). See ?physics for details}

\item{small}{value below which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region. Defaulted to -500. Passed on to physics(). See ?physics for details}

\item{maxjump}{forcing for jump2() in absolute mode (in the same units of the variable). Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{maxseq}{maximum number of consecutive repeated values, for flat function (11.1,11.1,11.1 would be 3 consecutive values). Passed on to flat(). See ?flat for details}

\item{margina}{tolerance margin, expressed as quantile of the differences, FUNCTION: newfriki(). Passed on to newfriki(). See ?newfriki for details}

\item{level}{number of IQRs for IQRoutliers()}

\item{window}{number of days to be considered (including the target), FUNCTION: IQRoutliers()}

\item{roundmax}{maximum number of consecutive decimal part value, for flat function (10.0, 11.0, 12.0 would be 3 consecutive value). Passed on to flat()}

\item{blockmanymonth}{maximum number of equal values in a month, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blockmanyyear}{maximum number of equal values in a year, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blocksizeround}{the maximum number of repeated values with the same decimal, FUNCTION: roundprecip()}

\item{qjump}{quantile for jump2 in quantile mode. Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{tjump}{factor to multiply the quantile value for jump2. Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{inisia}{logical flag. If it is TRUE inithome() will be called}

\description{
This function will centralize temperature-like QC routines. It will QC files for temperature. Reads all the temperature data in the
./raw folder (TX, TN or TG) and quality controls each of them. Notice that ECA&D stores temperature in 1/10th of Celsius degrees when entering new parameter values
