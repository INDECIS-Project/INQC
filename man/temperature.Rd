\arguments{
\item{large}{value above which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region. Defaulted to 500. Passed on to physics(). See ?physics for details}

\item{small}{value below which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region. Defaulted to -500. Passed on to physics(). See ?physics for details}

\item{maxjump}{forcing for jump2 in absolute mode (in the same units of the variable). Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{maxseq}{maximum number of consecutive repeated values, for flat function (11.1,11.1,11.1 would be 3 consecutives). Passed on to flat(). See ?flat for details}

\item{margina}{quantile. Passed on to newfriki(). See ?newfriki for details}

\item{level}{should be described later}

\item{window}{should be described later}

\item{roundmax}{maximum number of consecutive decimal part value, for flat function (10.0, 11.0, 12.0 would be 3 consecutive). Passed on to flat()}

\item{blocksize}{should be described later}

\item{step}{should be described later}

\item{blockmanymonth}{should be described later}

\item{blockmanyyear}{should be described later}

\item{blocksizeround}{should be described later}

\item{qjump}{quantile for jump2 in quantile mode. Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{tjump}{factor to multiply the quantile value for jump2. Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{element}{two-letters ECA&D code for the element ('TX' for daily maximum temperature,
'TN' for daily minimum temperature, 'TG' for daily mean temperature) passed as character string}

\item{inisia}{a logical flag. If it is TRUE inithome() will be called}

results of QC for TX/TN/TG
}
\description{
This function will centralize temperature-like qc routines. It will QC files for temperature. Reads all the temperature data in the
./raw folder (TX, TN or TG) and quality controls each of them. Notice that ECA&D stores temperature in 1/10th of ÂªC when entering new parameter values
