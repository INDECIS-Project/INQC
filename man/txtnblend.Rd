\description{
This function first looks for the closest station and then merges both dataframes.
If one value is flagged, looks at the ecdfs of tx and tn. If the target variable (e.g tx) is central
(between quantiles 0.2 and 0.8) and the other variable (e.g. tn) is outside this range, the value is
not flagged, assuming the other variable is the culprit
