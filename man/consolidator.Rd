Summary file,  placed at ./QCSumamry/SummaryVV_SOUIDXXXXXX.txt;

\description{
This function is not intended to be called as a stand-alone function. It is automatically called each time a file ends its QC.
It will write the quality control files. One file will be placed in a subfolder of the homefolder named QCConslidated. It will use the exact ECA&D
format (date, value, qcflag). The QCflag file includes:

0: Passed QC;
1: ERROR;
2: ALMOST CERTAIN, ERROR;
3: OUTLIER, SUSPECT;
4: COLLECTIVELY SUSPECT;
9: Missing value.

A second file is placed in the subfolder QC and includes all date, value and a column for each QC test ran over this file. Values passing/not passing QC
are labelled with 0/1. A third file sumarizes the number of values falling on each category (0,1,2,3,4,9) and the number of values failing each test
}
