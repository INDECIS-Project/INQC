\arguments{
\item{element}{two-letters ECA&D code for the element (PP for sea level pressure)}

\item{large}{value above which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region}

\item{small}{value below which the observation is considered physically impossible for the region}

\item{maxjump}{forcing for jump2() in absolute mode (in the same units of the variable). Passed on to jump2(). See ?jump2 for further details.}

\item{maxseq}{maximum number of consecutive repeated values, for flat function (11.1,11.1,11.1 would be 3 consecutive values)}

\item{margina}{tolerance margin, expressed as quantile of the differences, FUNCTION: newfriki(). Passed on to newfriki(). See ?newfriki for details}

\item{level}{number of IQRs for IQR outliers}

\item{window}{window, in days, for IQR outliers}

\item{roundmax}{maximum number of consecutive decimal part value, for flat function (10.0, 11.0, 12.0 would be 3 consecutive values)}

\item{blockmanymonth}{maximum number of equal values in a month, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blockmanyyear}{maximum number of equal values in a year, FUNCTION: toomany()}

\item{blocksizeround}{maximum number of values in a month with the same decimal, for rounding function}

\item{qjump}{quantile for the calculated maximum jump allowed}

\item{tjump}{factor to multiply the qjump computed differences}

\item{inisia}{a logical flag. If it is TRUE inithome() will be called}

results of QC for PP

\description{
This function will centralize temperature-like QC routines. It will create a file in the folder QC
with an additional 0/1 column where "1" means test failed.
